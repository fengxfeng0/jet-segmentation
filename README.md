# Overview
This project provides two datasets related to jet segmentation: **Libary** and **SegQinhu**. These datasets are intended to support researchers and developers to promote research and applications in the field of jet segmentation.

# Dataset Description

## 1. Libary Dataset
- **Description**: The Libary dataset contains 1300 pixel-level annotated image data, including 1100 training images, 100 validation images, and 100 test images.
- **Characteristic**: The pixel ratio of the jet trajectory is very small, accounting for only 1.4%.

## 2. SegQinhu Dataset
- **Description**: The SegQinhu dataset consists of 823 images with pixel-level annotations, including 700 training images, 23 validation images, and 100 test images.
- **Characteristic**: The pixel ratio of the jet trajectory is very small, accounting for only 2.8%.
